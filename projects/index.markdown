Windows Phone

#### [Metropas][Metropas] ####
I've been doing Windows Phone development out of personal interest since it launched back fall 2010. I have currently published one application called Metropas. You can find more information about it [here][Metropas].

Windows 8

#### [Klipit][klipit] ####
I've developed a [Kippt][kippt] Windows 8 client called Klipit as a way to study the way to develop Windows 8 applications and also because I thought it might be useful. See [here][klipit] for more.
