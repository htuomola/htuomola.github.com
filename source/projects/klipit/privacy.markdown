Handling Kippt credentials
---
We only ask your Kippt username and password once and they’re only used once to retrieve an API Token. If you tick the “remember credentials” box we’ll store the API Token safely for accessing your data in the future. If you don’t choose to remember credentials, they are discarded when you exit the application (and will be prompted again on next start). If you’ve chosen to synchronize passwords between your Windows 8/RT computers from Windows’ settings, your Kippt API Token is automatically synchronized to all your computers for a single sign-on experience.

Should you wish to revoke Kippt access from Klipit, you can either a) go to settings charm and choose “Disconnect from Kippt”, which will delete your credentials or b) go to [http://kippt.com][kippt] and change your password, which will in turn invalidate your old API Token.
