My name is Henri Tuomola. I currently work as a software developer at [Avanade Finland][avanade]. I'm really interested in software development, photography and technical stuff in general. Lately I've been looking specifically into Windows Phone and Windows Store development during my spare time (when possible).

I'm experienced in doing custom development using the .NET Framework and Web Services. I've been developing for .NET since version 2.0. I've also got two years of experience on large-scale enterprise integrations using BizTalk Server versions 2006 R2 and 2009. Lately I've concentrated more on mobile application development on Windows Phone and Windows 8.

I've spent one and a half years studying and working in France and I speak fluent French (in addition to English, naturally). For a more complete résumé, check out my [LinkedIn profile][linkedin].

Please note that this is my personal website and the opinions expressed here might not represent those of my employer.
